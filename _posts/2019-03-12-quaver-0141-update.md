After every large update for Quaver, we love to spend time getting feedback from our testers and dedicating the next update to quality of life, bug fixes, and general improvements to the game. This time around, we've released version 0.14.1 of Quaver which has just that. Be sure to check out all the updates listed below as well as continue to report bugs and give feedback on things you'd like to see in the game.

# Game Client Updates

**Alpha Testers**

Restart your Steam client, and the game will automatically update for you.

**Non-Alpha Testers**

You can grab the latest version of the game on [GitHub](https://github.com/Quaver/Quaver/releases/tag/0.14.1), but you will not be able to access any online features.

## Editor - Viewing & Skinning Layers

Based on your feedback, it's no doubt that using the layering feature in the editor was fairly difficult to see if you didn't have a skin with white colored notes enabled. We've made it so that viewing layers are completely optional as well as made it so you're able to skin the layered objects. You can check out the [wiki](https://quavergame.com/wiki/Skins/) to get more information on how to customize them.

## Offset Calibrator

One of the main things that was missing in Quaver was the ability to change your global offset in-game. We've now added two ways to change it. One is with a slider in the options menu and another with the "Offset Calibrator." With the offset calibrator, the game will have you play a sample map and suggest a new offset for you to use. This same type of calibrator is used in games such as ITG and StepMania.

## Modifier Leaderboards

Among one of the most highly requested features was the ability to filter online scores in song select by the modifiers used on them. This is now possible with the new "Mods" leaderboard section we've added.

# Game Server Updates

Furthermore, we've also spent some time completely rewriting the game server to get it more stable and fast for multiplayer. If you were previously experiencing random disconnections, this should be gone. If you're still experiencing issues with this, be sure to report it to us as soon as you can.
