The time has finally arrived! After almost 4 months since our initial reveal, Quaver is now in closed alpha, and our game client is open source! As a team, we've been working super hard to make sure we were both on-time and ready. We've put in a ton of work into this project, and we're very glad to finally share it with you guys!

# Closed Steam Alpha

The alpha will take place on Steam. You can head over to [our website](https://quavergame.com), and sign right up! If you're accepted, you'll be given a Steam key by email to access the game and start playing. **Please make sure you're following all of the requirements listed down both below and on our website, or you will not be able to join.**

**Please keep in mind that the amount of keys we are giving out are limited, and not everyone will be able to obtain one.** For this alpha, we're going to be handing out keys gradually, so not everyone will be able to receive a Steam key on day 1. We also may limit the amount of keys we give out to an undecided number of people. We're doing this so we can measure the performance of our servers and iron out any initial issues players might experience. We'll be accepting people over the upcoming weeks and will let you know if/when we decide to close applications.

## Requirements To Join

There are a few requirements that must be met in order to be accepted to receive a Steam key. 

1. **Required Operating System** - Windows 8, Windows 8.1, or Windows 10
     - â€¢ **Note:** We're currently working on compatibility for Windows 7, so the game is not available for that operating system at this time.
2. A Steam account
3. A [Discord](https://discordapp.com) account and are **currently in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nJa8VFr)**.

If you are accepted and following these requirements, you will be sent an email at the address you've provided on our sign up form. You will also be given a role on our Discord server and access to a private channel dedicated specifically for alpha testers.

## How long will you be in closed alpha?

We'll have this Steam-key based system for quite a while, and we can't give an accurate measure as to when Quaver will be out of closed alpha for everyone to access. We want to make sure both the Quaver client and server are both in a state where it is considered complete, and to where we can sustain a large influx of users at one time.

## What if I don't get in?

If you don't get access to the alpha and you still want to play, don't be discouraged. You can still play! Check out the next section regarding open source where you can check out the game immediately!

# Our Game Client Is Open Source!

As promised, our game client has now been open sourced with this alpha release and will be going forward. You can head over to our [GitHub](https://github.com/Quaver) and check our all of our repositories related to our game client and more. You won't be able to access any online features using an unofficial build, but the game is still readily available for you to play if you compile it.

## How To Contribute

If you're looking to contribute to Quaver - whether with code, designs, or ideas, you should first join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/nJa8VFr). This is where we collaborate and discuss about the game.

Contributing code is as simple as forking any of our repositories and submitting a pull request. There are a bunch of issues to work on in all portions of the client, and we could definitely use some help with them!

# Giving Feedback

<p align="center">

</p>

Your feedback is very important to us. We want to hear what you like, dislike, and what you want to see in Quaver going forward. We're aiming to build this game from the ground up as a community, and this isn't possible without your input. 

## Feature Requests & Bug Reports

If you want to submit any feature requests or report bugs, you can do so by submitting an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Quaver/Quaver/issues). We take a look at all issues that are brought up and try our best to either fix them or have a discussion surrounding them. This is the most effective place to get your voice heard when it comes to Quaver, as anyone can contribute to the conversation as well.

# Conclusion

As always, if you've made it this far, thanks for reading! We hope you enjoy Quaver as much as we've enjoyed developing it. As with everything, the game is not perfect, and there's still a ton of work to be done. We believe its time to give you all a taste of what Quaver has to offer, and the amount of potential it has to become a great game. However, this isn't possible without **you**. 

Try out the game, see how it plays, and give us feedback on what you like and what you want us to improve on. Nothing is set in stone, and we can always adjust the game as necessary. 

Thanks for reading, and happy holidays, everyone!
